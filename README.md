# VoiceFlow üé§

**VoiceFlow** is an intelligent voice assistant powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and trained using **spaCy**. It understands your voice commands and performs tasks like opening apps, adjusting system settings, and more. With accurate intent recognition and entity extraction, VoiceFlow makes your daily tasks effortless and efficient.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Voice Commands**: Speak naturally to control your system.
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately predicts user intents (e.g., open app, adjust volume).
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key details like app names or volume levels.
- **Task Automation**: Performs tasks like opening apps, shutting down, or adjusting settings.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to you with spoken feedback.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Speech-to-Text**: 
   - The app listens to your voice using a microphone.
   - Converts your speech into text using the `speech_recognition` library.

2. **Intent Prediction**:
   - The transcribed text is passed to a **spaCy NLP model**.
   - The model predicts the intent (e.g., "open_app") and extracts entities (e.g., "Chrome").

3. **Task Execution**:
   - Based on the predicted intent, the app performs the corresponding action:
     - Open apps.
     - Adjust volume.
     - Shutdown or restart the system.
     - Copy/paste text.

4. **Text-to-Speech**:
   - The app responds to you with spoken feedback using `pyttsx3`.

## Usage üéØ

1. Speak a command like:
   - "Open Chrome"
   - "Increase the volume to 50 percent"
   - "Shutdown the system"

2. The app will:
   - Understand your command.
   - Perform the task.
   - Respond with spoken feedback.

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.7+
- Microphone (for voice input)
- Libraries: `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `spacy`, `pyperclip`, `pyaudio`

---

## Future Enhancements üîÆ

- Add more intents (e.g., weather, reminders).
- Improve entity recognition for complex commands.
- Integrate with cloud-based NLP models for better accuracy.
- Add support for multiple languages.
